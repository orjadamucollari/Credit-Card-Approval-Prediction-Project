- Predicting if a credit card application will be approved or not.
- This project uses Jupyter notebook for python programming to build the machine learning model.

#### Data source

- [Kaggle credit card approval prediction](https://www.kaggle.com/rikdifos/credit-card-approval-prediction)

### Conceptual Overview
Banks receive a lot of credit card applications. Many of the applications do not get approved for a variety of reasons, like increased loan balances or poor-income levels. Manually analyzing these applications can be very time-consuming and full of human errors. Thankfully, we can automate this task with the help of machine learning. Below are the concepts and theories that helped understand the project solution and are an integral part of this process. A thorough understanding of them facilitated the development process.


## Data description
👉 There are 2 datasets will be used in this notebook:
* `Application record` (contains general information about applicant, such as applicant gender, DOB, education type, assets that applicant had, etc.)
* `Credit record` (contains applicant's loan payment records)

👉 There are 18 variables in application record data set:
* 12 categorical variables,
* 5 continuous variables, and
* 1 variable to accommodate the applicant ID.

👉 There are 3 variables in credit record data set:
* 1 categorical variable,
* 1 continuousvariable, and
* 1 variable to accommodate the applicant ID.
